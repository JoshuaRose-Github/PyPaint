# PyPaint
A painting visualiser programmed in python 3.8 
I made this in math class and it kind of took off from there. Now it's more of a full time project. I'm trying to work on it as consistantly as I can but balancing it with studies and other stuff is challenging. I will update the program on GitHub as constantly as possible. If you have any issues, please submit them in the issues tab which I will link to.


## Install
You need pygame. In beta 1.1 I will make a requirements and setup file.
