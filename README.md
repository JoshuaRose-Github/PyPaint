# PyPaint
A painting visualiser programmed in python 3.8 
I made this in math class and it kind of took off from there. Now it's more of a full time project. I'm trying to work on it as consistantly as I can but balancing it with studies and other stuff is challenging. I will update the program on GitHub as constantly as possible. If you have any issues, please submit them in the issues tab which I will link to.


### Install
- You need pygame. Requirements file and setup file to be done soon. Reasons being this is quite a sketchy little thing and I'm just working on the actual script now and doing filework later. Possible in next pre-release. 
- You also need python 3.8 > . This program is not compatible with any other version of python pre-dating 3.8. 

### Execution
- The preferred method of execution is through a text editor 
- This program also however, can be run through a command line but it is not as consistant and could have bugs. Again, if there are any bugs present, feel free to document them in the issues tab and tag it with 'bug' and I will try and get to it when I can. 

### Libraries
- Math
- PyGame
